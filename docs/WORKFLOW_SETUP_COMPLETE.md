# Development Workflow Setup - Complete ✅

## Summary

Your GoalCast development workflow is now fully configured and ready for production use!

## ✅ What Was Set Up

### 1. Pre-commit Hooks (.pre-commit-config.yaml)
Automated quality checks that run **before every commit**:
- ✅ **Ruff Linting** - Code quality checks
- ✅ **Ruff Formatting** - Auto-format Python code
- ✅ **MyPy** - Static type checking
- ✅ **Bandit** - Security vulnerability scanning
- ✅ **File Quality** - Trailing whitespace, line endings, YAML/JSON validation

**Status:** ✅ Installed and active
**Run manually:** `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`

### 2. GitHub Actions CI/CD (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
Automated quality checks that run **on every push and PR**:
- ✅ Ruff linting and formatting checks
- ✅ MyPy type checking
- ✅ Bandit security scanning
- ✅ Pytest with coverage reporting
- ✅ Codecov integration (optional)
- ✅ Package build verification
- ✅ Semgrep security scanning (PRs only)

**Status:** ✅ Configured and will run on next PR
**View runs:** `gh run list` or check GitHub Actions tab

### 3. Pull Request Template (.github/pull_request_template.md)
Structured PR template with:
- ✅ Description and related issues section
- ✅ Type of change checklist
- ✅ Testing evidence requirements
- ✅ Quality checks checklist
- ✅ Review instructions

**Status:** ✅ Will auto-populate on PR creation

### 4. Documentation
Comprehensive guides created:
- ✅ **docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md** - Branch protection and naming conventions
- ✅ **docs/WORKFLOW.md** - Complete development workflow guide
- ✅ **docs/DEV_ENV_SETUP.md** - Environment setup instructions
- ✅ **docs/PROJECT_SETUP_SUMMARY.md** - Project initialization summary

## 📋 Recommended Git Workflow

### **Simplified Feature Branch Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/epic-1-data-ingestion

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(data): implement fixtures ingestion"
# ✅ Pre-commit hooks run automatically

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/epic-1-data-ingestion

# 4. Create Pull Request
gh pr create --title "feat(data): Fixtures ingestion pipeline" \
             --body "Implements #8 for EPIC #1"

# 5. GitHub Actions CI runs automatically ✅

# 6. Review and merge
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch

# 7. Update local main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

## 🎯 Branching Strategy

### Branch Types

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Main | `main` | `main` (protected) |
| Feature | `feature/<epic>-<desc>` | `feature/epic-1-data-ingestion` |
| Bugfix | `bugfix/<issue>-<desc>` | `bugfix/123-xg-validation` |
| Enhancement | `enhancement/<desc>` | `enhancement/add-correlation` |
| Refactor | `refactor/<desc>` | `refactor/extract-validators` |
| Docs | `docs/<desc>` | `docs/api-endpoints` |

---

## 💬 Commit Message Convention

### Semantic Commits (Conventional Commits)

```bash
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Adding/updating tests
- **chore**: Tooling, dependencies, config
- **perf**: Performance improvement
- **ci**: CI/CD configuration

### Scopes
- `data`, `models`, `simulation`, `llm`, `api`, `ui`, `utils`, `tests`, `ci`, `deps`

### Examples

```bash
git commit -m "feat(models): implement Poisson baseline model"
git commit -m "fix(data): handle missing xG values in validation"
git commit -m "test(simulation): add Monte Carlo edge case tests"
git commit -m "chore(deps): upgrade pandas to 2.3.4"
```

## 🔒 Branch Protection (To Be Configured)

### Recommended Settings for `main` Branch

Navigate to: `https://github.com/LinoGoncalves/GoalCast/settings/branches`

**Configure:**
1. ✅ Require pull request before merging
2. ✅ Require 1 approval (you review AI code, or GitHub bot reviews yours)
3. ✅ Require status checks to pass:
   - `ruff-lint`
   - `ruff-format-check`
   - `mypy`
   - `pytest`
4. ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
5. ✅ Require linear history (optional)
6. ❌ Include administrators (allow yourself to bypass in emergencies)

**Action Required:** You'll need to configure this manually in GitHub settings after the first PR triggers CI.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Start EPIC #1 (Data Foundation)
```bash
# Create user story issue
gh issue create --title "Ingest fixtures data from PremierLeague.com" \
                --label "user-story" \
                --milestone "EPIC 1: Data Foundation"

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/epic-1-fixtures-ingestion

# Start coding!
# (AI can help implement this)
```

### Option 2: Start EPIC #2 (Statistical Modeling)
```bash
# Create user story issue
gh issue create --title "Implement Poisson baseline prediction model" \
                --label "user-story" \
                --milestone "EPIC 2: Statistical Modeling"

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/epic-2-poisson-model

# Start coding!
```

### Option 3: Test the Workflow First
```bash
# Create test branch
git checkout -b test/workflow-validation

# Make a trivial change (e.g., update README)
echo "Testing workflow..." >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: test workflow with trivial change"

# Push and create PR to verify CI works
git push origin test/workflow-validation
gh pr create --title "test: Validate CI/CD workflow"

# Check GitHub Actions run
gh run list

# Merge if successful
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Pre-commit hook fails?
```bash
# Auto-fix formatting
uv run ruff format src/ tests/
git add .
git commit -m "..."
```

### CI fails but tests pass locally?
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.13.x

# Sync dependencies
uv sync --all-extras --dev
```

### Need to bypass hooks in emergency?
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "fix: emergency hotfix"
```

        Scenario: Successfully ingest xG data
          Given Understat.com API is available
          When the xG ingestion pipeline runs
          Then xG data is downloaded and stored in CSV format
          And data quality checks pass (no missing values, valid xG range 0-1)
          And audit trail captures source URL, timestamp, and data hash
        ```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Choose Your Path)

#### **Option A: Start with Data Foundation (Recommended)**
Engage the **Data Engineer AI Assistant** to design and implement EPIC 1:
- Define data schemas (fixtures, odds, xG, injuries, rival picks)
- Design ingestion pipeline architecture
- Implement web scraping for free EPL data sources
- Create data validation and versioning system

#### **Option B: Start with Statistical Modeling**
Engage the **Data Scientist AI Assistant** to prototype EPIC 2:
- Implement baseline Poisson model
- Research Dixon-Coles adjustments
- Design Bayesian hierarchical framework
- Prototype xG integration

#### **Option C: Create User Stories**
Break down EPIC 1 (or another) into detailed user stories:
- Use the GitHub user story template
- Add Gherkin acceptance criteria
- Link to parent epic
- Assign story points

## 🎯 Human Oversight Mode: HYBRID

**Current Mode**: HYBRID  
**What this means**:
- ✅ AI proceeds autonomously through implementation steps
- ⏸️ AI pauses at key decision points for human approval
- 🔄 You can switch modes at any time with `MODE: [STEPWISE|AUTONOMOUS|STANDARD]`

**Autonomous Reasoning Active**:
- ✅ Quantum Thinking Framework (multi-dimensional analysis)
- ✅ Critical Analysis (assumption validation)
- ✅ Research Specialist (best practices, data sources)

---

## 🚦 Awaiting Your Direction

**What would you like to do next?**

1. **Start EPIC 1 (Data Foundation)** - Build the data ingestion pipeline
2. **Start EPIC 2 (Statistical Modeling)** - Prototype the Poisson/Dixon-Coles models
3. **Create User Stories** - Break down an epic into detailed user stories
4. **Setup Development Environment** - Install uv, create virtual env, install dependencies
5. **Explore Project Structure** - Create initial Python package structure (`src/goalcast/`)
6. **Other** - Specify your preferred next action

Please provide your decision, and I'll engage the appropriate AI agents and begin execution in HYBRID mode. 🎯
